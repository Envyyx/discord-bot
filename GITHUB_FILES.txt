DISCORD BOT - GITHUB UPLOAD GUIDE
=====================================

You need to create these 3 folders with the following files:

1. CREATE FOLDER: commands
   - Create: commands/music.js
   - Create: commands/games.js  
   - Create: commands/utilities.js
   - Create: commands/social.js
   - Create: commands/sports.js

2. CREATE FOLDER: config
   - Create: config/config.js

3. CREATE FOLDER: utils
   - Create: utils/helpers.js

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
====================

1. In your GitHub repository, click "Create new file"
2. Type: commands/music.js (this creates the commands folder automatically)
3. Copy-paste the content from your Replit commands/music.js file
4. Repeat for all 8 files listed above

SHORTCUT: 
=========
Instead of typing all the code, you can:
1. Open each file in your Replit workspace
2. Copy the entire content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)  
3. Paste it into the corresponding GitHub file

FILES TO COPY:
==============
✅ package.json (DONE)
✅ index.js (DONE)
✅ README.md (DONE)
✅ .gitignore (DONE)
⏳ commands/music.js (NEED TO DO)
⏳ commands/games.js (NEED TO DO)

⏳ commands/social.js (NEED TO DO)
⏳ commands/sports.js (NEED TO DO)
